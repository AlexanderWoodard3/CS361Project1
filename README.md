# CS361Project1
Deterministic Finite Automata

## Synopsis
```
java fa.dfa.DFADriver ./tests/<SomeFile>.txt
```

## Description
This java program models a deterministic finite automata that recognizes a language.

## Compiling and Using
```
javac fa/dfa/DFADriver.java
java fa.dfa.DFADriver ./tests/<SomeFile>.txt
```

# Some notes
Implementing a DFA was relatively straightforward with the provided classes and documentation. This application
passed the provided tests. Quinn is certainly glad that he opted for a partner. Debugging issues went much 
faster with two heads rather than just one.
